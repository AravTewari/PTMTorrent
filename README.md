## About

This repository contains the scripts to generate the *PTMTorrent* dataset.

*PTMTorrent* is a dataset created to be submitted to the
[2023 Mining Software Repositories (MSR) Confrence Data and Tool Showcase Track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/msr-2023/msr-2023-data-showcase).
The dataset contains either the partial or entire set of pre-trained machine
learning models (PTM) repositories hosted on popular model hubs.

> Model hubs are, "collections of PTMs and datasets organized by problem domain"
> (from ICSE paper).

The list of currently supported model hubs can be found
[here](#supported-model-hubs).
