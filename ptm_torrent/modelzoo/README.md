## About

This directory contains the scripts to download PTM repositories and extract
metadata for the greater *PTMTorrent* dataset from
[Model Zoo](https://modelzoo.co).

To download the entirety of the [Model Zoo](https://modelzoo.co) model hub
requires nGB of storage.

## How to Run

To run the scripts within this directory, the larger `ptm_torrent` project and
its dependencies must first be installed. See this project's root
[`README.md`](../../README.md) for more information.

### Through [`__main__.py`](__main__.py)

- `python __main__.py`

### As Individual Files

> This method assumes that you accept all of the default values of the scripts.
> Changes can be made manually within the scripts if the defualts are not
> acceptable for your use case.

1. `python setupFileSystem.py`
1. `python downloadHubJSON.py`
1. `python downloadModelJSON.py`
1. `python downloadRepos.py`
1. `python createSchema.py`

## Data Representation

> The following directory structure was taken on 1/25/2023. Files within the
> `data/modelzoo/json/metadata/models` directory have been removed from the
> output to save space.

```shell
📦data
 ┗ 📂modelzoo
 ┃ ┣ 📂html
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📂metadata

```

> This directory structure is generated relative to where the script is ran
> from. Example: if the script was ran from the home directory (`~`), then the
> `data` directory would be stored at `~/data`.

Where:

- data/modelzoo/repos/`AUTHOR` is the author name of the repository that was
  cloned.
- data/modelzoo/repos/AUTHOR/`MODEL` is the name of the repository that was
  cloned.

Model hub scripts do not overwrite the directory. In other words, it is a safe
operation to run multiple model hub scripts from the same directory sequentially
or concurrently.

### Data Directory Specifics

#### `data/modelzoo/html`

This directory is not currently utilized by our scripts. It is kept within the
program for consistency across model hubs.

#### `data/modelzoo/json`

This directory contains JSON files formatted to fit specific schemas.

The top level file (`modelzoo.json`) is formatted to work with the general
[PTMTorrent JSON Schema](../utils/schemas/onnxmodelhubModelMetadata.json).

#### `data/modelzoo/json/metadata`

This directory contains JSON files formatted to fit specific schemas.

The file (`mz_metadata.json`) is formatted to work with the
[Model Zoo hub metadata JSON Schema](../utils/schemas/modelZooHubMetadata.json).

The file (`mz_model_metadata.json`) is formatted to work with the
[Model Zoo model metadata JSON Schema](../utils/schemas/modelZooModelMetadata.json).

#### `data/modelzoo/repos`

This directory contains the repository downloaded from the model hub.

Repositories are downloaded into this directory in the format `AUTHOR/REPO`.

Repositories paths are generated by taking the `git` compatible cloning URL and
parsing it for the model *author* and *owner*

> Example: <https://github.com/SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/PTM-Torrent> ->
> SoftwareSystemsLaboratory/PTM-Torrent
